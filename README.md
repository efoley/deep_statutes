# About

This repo contains a bunch of experimental code for dealing with state legal statutes.

The immediate goal is to:
* download a bunch of state statutes (mostly in either PDF or HTML format)
* parse them into a semi-structured format
* output a bunch of markdown or asciidoc files that are easy to use as context for LLMs
